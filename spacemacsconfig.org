* Current practice
*** .spacemacs file lies on github (DON'T FORGET TO PUSH CHANGES)
*** "~/.spacemacs" used as symbolic link with target /repos/spacemacsconfigs/.spacemacs 
*** dotspacemacs-configuration-layers has been replaced by mjl-layers, to be able to support different layer setups for linux and windows
* Problems 
* Questions/TODO's 
** General: 
*** TODO different paths for differnet machines in loading dotspacemacs 
*** TODO different path specification on different machines?
*** TODO org-agenda files, different paths on different machines
*** DONE different packages loading on different platforms
    CLOSED: [2018-01-03 Wed 16:31]
*** TODO different packages loading on different system-names
    take a look at: http://milosophical.me/blog/2016/spacemacs-01.html
*** would it be better to use .spacemacs.d/init... 
** Linux:
*** TODO git commit problem (emacs 24 seems to have a problem), pushing works 
** Windows: 
*** pdf-tools alternative (sumatra: https://www.barik.net/archive/2012/07/18/154432/)

* Current practice
*** .spacemacs file lies on github (DON'T FORGET TO PUSH CHANGES)
*** "~/.spacemacs" used as symbolic link with target /repos/spacemacsconfigs/.spacemacs 
*** dotspacemacs-configuration-layers has been replaced by mjl-layers, to be able to support different layer setups for linux and windows
* Problems 
* Questions/TODO's 
** General: 
*** TODO different paths for differnet machines in loading dotspacemacs 
*** TODO different path specification on different machines?
*** would it be better to use .spacemacs.d/init... 
** Linux:
*** TODO git commit problem (emacs 24 seems to have a problem), pushing works 
*** still???? .spacemacs (symlic) can be opened by SPC f e d but not reinitialized by SPC f e R 
** Windows: 
*** pdf-tools alternative (sumatra: https://www.barik.net/archive/2012/07/18/154432/)

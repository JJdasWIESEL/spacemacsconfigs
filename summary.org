* List of questions on how to use github, config file
*** Linux: .spacemacs (symlic) can be opened by SPC f e d but not reinitialized by SPC f e R 
*** different path specification on different machines?
*** would it be better to use .spacemacs.d/init... 

* Current practice
*** .spacemacs file lies on github (DON'T FORGET TO PUSH CHANGES)
*** "~/.spacemacs" used as symbolic link with target /repos/spacemacsconfigs/.spacemacs
